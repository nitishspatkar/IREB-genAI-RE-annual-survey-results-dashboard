This file contains a dictionary mapping original CSV column names to
simplified labels for easier analysis and visualization.

IMPORTANT:
- Each key must match EXACTLY what appears in your CSV header row.
- If you have repeated columns (like multiple "What is your current country of residence?"),
  give each one a unique new name (e.g. country_residence_1, country_residence_2, etc.)
- Make sure you remove any line that says 'from rename_config import rename_mapping'
  in this file to avoid circular imports.

    # AWARENESS OF DIGITAL SUSTAINABILITY
    "We consider Digital Sustainability an umbrella term for two aspects: Sustainable Software and Sustainable by Software.  Sustainable Software concerns the sustainability of digital solutions in terms of their impact on environmental, economic, technical, social, and individual dimensions, including carbon footprint (Green IT) and process resources.
